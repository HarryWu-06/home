					Hi, my name is Harry Wu, and I was made in China on Jan 6th,2006. I am an artificial intelligence product, haven’t 
					lost a body part yet, still working very well after running 14 years. However, I’m 183cm tall and weigh 65kg now.

				<img id = "family" src = "images/family.png" alt = "a picture of 4 family members">
				<p>
					I came to Canada just last year with my whole family which includes my mother, my father, my sister and me. My mother
					sends my sister to the kindergarten and my father drives me to VP every workday.(Of course, it’s before the Covid-19).
					Now, most of us are staying at home waiting for the pandemic to go away.

				<img id = "grades" src = "images/grades.jpg" alt = "a picture of a good grade">
				<p>
					I’m pretty good at math and physics due to the 10-year-education in China, but on the other hand, my English and French
					is bad. I wish to learn lots of things from you, mostly the language part. And I can help you with some math problems too. 
				</p>

				<img id = "hobby" src = "images/hobby.jpg" alt = "a picture of a lots of hobbies">
				<p>
					For sports, I love to play basketball and go swimming, and I’ve been doing these sports for years, not to say that I’m
					a pro, but at least I won’t hold others back. In the weekends(in the normal days), I'll usually practice my guitar skills, 
					and watch some anime, these two are great resting activities instead of gaming.
