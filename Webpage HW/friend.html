				We have became good friends because of a summer camp in Britain, we stayed there 
				for 2 weeks and played together most of the time. After that experience, we meet up
				every Saturday to do some exercise(running), and after about a 20-minute-run, we will 
				end up in a KFC with phones in our hands(playing PubG).

				I knew him when I was still in elementary school(because he was a very handsome boy),
				and he knew me because we went to the same extracurricular training courses, but we 
				became friends when we became classmates in middle school. Long time ago, we played 
				Majiang together after school(though we are supposed to study).
