			<h1>Games</h1>
			<br><hr><br>
			<h2>[Minecraft]</h2>
			<p>
				One of the most popular and best sandbox games in the world, I started playing the game when 
				I was 7 because of the huge hype. The controls are simple, have lots of ways to play, and the 
				great amount of modes are also an attractive point. But I only have the Chinese version which 
				is not as good as the international one(fewer input and ways to play) D: SAD. I really wish to 
				have a international version.
			</p>
			<br><hr><br>	
			<h2>[PubG]</h2>
			<p>
				PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an online multiplayer battle royale game, this game 
				was very popular in 2016, and the mobile version came out in 2018. Me and my classmates played
				it a lot, I have lots of good memories of this game. But now they all have no time to play(studying)
				and left me alone…(it's a sad story, isn't it?)
			</p>
			<br><hr><br>
			<h2>[Brawl Stars]</h2>
			<p>
				Brawl Stars is a multiplayer online battle arena and third-person hero shooter game where players
				battle against other players or AI opponents in multiple game modes. I like this game because of 
				the variety of gameplay and character, though sometimes my teammates  are bad at this game, but if
				we are just having fun, it’s all ok. But of course, if I was going to push the trophies, then 
				that's not happy at all.
			</p>
			<br><hr><br>
			<h2>[Genshin Impact]</h2>
			<p>
				A very hyped game nowadays. To describe the game, in my words is “A group of anime girls and anime 
				boys fighting nice looking mobs with all kinds of elements” Well the girls are for sure beautiful…(coughing)
				The drawing of the game is beautiful and the game is fun, the only problem is that I have nothing new to do after
				being in a high level.
			</p>
			<br><hr><br>
			<h2>My Favor</h2>
			<p>
				If you look carefully enough, you will find out that the games I like all multiplayer.<br>
				Playing alone really feels sad and lonely(especially in this Covid situation).<br>
				Playing multiplayer games will somehow someway fill up my lonely broken heart :D<br>
